        Christian Orthodox church. </li>

    <section id="travel">
      <h2>Travel to Skopje</h2>
      <p>
        The main airport is Skopje International Airport. Turkish Airlines offers convenient connections
        through Istanbul (if coming from the West coast), but other major European hubs have a connection 
        to Skopje. 

        There is a shuttle bus that takes passengers from the airport to the city center (the bus ticket is about $4). 
        You can find the timetable here: https://skp.airports.com.mk/en-EN/passenger-guide/to-from-the-airport/page/bus

        There are also taxis that can take you to the city center (cost is about $20).

    <section id="attire">
      <h2>Wedding Attire</h2>
      <p>
        We suggest elegant attire suitable for a formal celebration for the reception. If joining us at the church for the ceremony, 
        we recommend covering the shoulders. 
        
        Below are some examples of our friends' weddings. Women tend to wear cocktail or formal dresses, while men wear suits or tuxedos.
        Given that the temperature will be in the 90s, wearing lighter materials is probably a good idea. 
        
         </p>

    <section id="accommodation">
      <h2>Accommodation</h2>
      <p>
        We recommend staying at Hotel Park.  
        It is a 5-star hotel. This is also where the reception will take place and where the shuttles will do pick-up/drop-off 
        to the welcome party, ceremony, and after-party. 
        The rooms range from $80-100/night. 

        Please make your booking at the following link (suggested by June 1): 
        (Unfortunately, there is no code as this hotel does not do group discounts for wedding guests) 

        There are plenty of other options, too. Here are some other hotels that we'd recommend. 


        One can also find more affordable options on Booking.com and Airbnb. Nela is happy to help with booking and communication 
        if this arrangement is preferred over the hotels.
